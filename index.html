                <h4>Venue</h4>
                <p>We have chosen to hold the wedding at Siggesta Gård. The venue is in traditional swedish rural style with all the comforts of modern life. Expect to spend some time outside and bring clothing suitable for swedish summer weather (a mix of warm sunny days and chilly rain showers). Siggesta gård is located on Värmdö in the Stockholm archipelago and can be reached with public transport. </p>

                <h4>Hotel</h4>
                <p>Accomodation will be sorted through Siggesta Gård. There are 39 rooms with 89 beds on Siggesta Gård itself, and they work with several hotels close by to help us find accomodation for all of our guests. We have asked them to hold all their rooms for us. This means that no rooms are visible on their online booking service for that weekend. Siggesta will make it possible for you to book your rooms, this will only be available for a limited time however. More information and links to how to book your room will be available soon.

                <h4>Venue</h4>
                <p>We have chosen to hold the wedding at Siggesta Gård. The venue is in traditional swedish rural style with all the comforts of modern life. Expect to spend some time outside and bring clothing suitable for swedish summer weather (a mix of warm sunny days and chilly rain showers). Siggesta gård is located on Värmdö in the Stockholm archipelago and can be reached with public transport. </p>
